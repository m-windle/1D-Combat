# 1D-Combat
Description: This is a simple combat simulator I made to practice structs, inheritance, and simple randomization

This was an idea that a youtube tutorial I was following suggested as an exercise. (it can be found [here](https://youtu.be/TH7plF4UT_E))

I took this opportunity to see if I could apply what I knew about programming in other object oriented languages to this project.
Adding structs and inheritance may have been a bit much for such a simple project, but I learned quite a bit out of how
concepts like this apply in C++.
